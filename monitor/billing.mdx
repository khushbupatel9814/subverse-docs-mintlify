Key components include:
- **Available Balance**: Total funds available to cover upcoming charges.
- **Credits**: Promotional or earned credits applied to billing. Credits get consumed before balance recharge. If you have high volume requirements and want to test our platform, [reach out](https://dashboard.subverseai.com/customised-plan) to us to add some credits to your account.
- **Billing Preferences**: Manage tax-related information. Provide your business details such as registered name, address, email, and GSTIN for billing and invoicing.
- **Billing and Payment History**: Search invoices and receipts by amount or invoice number.
