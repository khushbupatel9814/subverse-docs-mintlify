LLM Tools define specific actions that AI agents can execute during live conversations, such as transferring the call, sending emails, updating databases, or checking order status.

## Default tools
- `transfer_call`: Transfer the call to humna agent to handle escalations.
- `end_call`: Hang up the call on closure.
- `query_knowledge_base`: Fetch more details from company knowledge base.

- Enter an **LLM Tool Name** (e.g., send_email).
- Provide a **Description** for what task it performs (e.g., "Sends an email to the customer").
- Set an **Error Message** in case function fails to perform the task (e.g., "Couldn't complete the task, tell them it will be done after call.").
- Set a **Return Message** for tasks running in background (e.g., "Task running in the background").
- Enable/Disable **Background Task** based on whether the function runs asynchronously. `Enable` this if you don't want the voice agent to wait for its completion e.g., sending an email to the customer. `Disable` if you want to wait for the task to finish before agent replies e.g., fetching order details.

## Add Parameters
Define parameters required by the tool with description so LLM can understand its use. This are passed as inputs to the executing function.
- Select a **Data Type** (e.g., `string`, `number`, `boolean`).
- Define an **Identifier** (e.g., `customer_email`).
- Add a **Description** to help the LLM understand the data. (e.g., "customer's email address").

## Start Using
- Save the Tool to make it available for AI agents.
- You can you can either use it in [voice agents](/voice-agents/llm-tools) or [workflows](/workflow/agent-blocks#ai-query-agent).

<Tip>
  Explicity instruct the AI agent to call tool to ensure it is always executed when required e.g., If user do not have any questions, call tool 'end_call' to hang up.
