## Outbound trunk
Setup your voice agent to make outgoing calls from your number.
### Create a SIP trunk
1. Buy a virtual number from your cloud telephony service provider.
2. There are 2 methods for authentication: IP whitelisting, or auth credentials.
3. Currently SubVerse SIP server does not have a static IP, so if you opt for the IP route, you need to whitelist all the IP addresses in the range like this: `0.0.0.0/1`, `128.0.0.0/1`.
4. It is recommended that you also setup Auth Username and Password for secure communication.
5. Refer to the configuration guides for [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/blog/elastic-sip-trunking-step-by-step-setup), [Telnyx](https://support.telnyx.com/en/articles/8096455-how-to-configure-a-sip-trunk#h_78916f5af1), [Vonage](https://developer.vonage.com/en/sip/sip-dashboard#outbound-calling), [Plivo](https://www.plivo.com/docs/sip-trunking#outbound-trunks-termination).

## Inbound trunk
Setup your voice agent to accept incoming calls on your number.
### Create a SIP trunk

2. Configure an inbound SIP trunk with **Origination URI** as `4ers9l0ayi7.sip.livekit.cloud`.
3. It is recommended that you also setup Auth Username and Password for secure communication.
4. Refer to the configuration guides for [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/blog/elastic-sip-trunking-step-by-step-setup), [Telnyx](https://support.telnyx.com/en/articles/8096455-how-to-configure-a-sip-trunk#h_78916f5af1), [Vonage](https://developer.vonage.com/en/sip/sip-dashboard#inbound-calling), [Plivo](https://www.plivo.com/docs/sip-trunking#inbound-trunks-origination).
