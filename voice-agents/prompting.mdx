## Initial Prompt
The **Initial Prompt** is the first message the agent speaks. Example:
```md
Hello, this is Puja from SubVerse AI. How may I assist you today?
```

## System Prompt
To enhance clarity and maintainability, it’s recommended to break down system prompts into distinct sections, each focusing on a specific aspect:

- **Identity**: Define the persona and role of the AI agent, setting the tone for interactions.
- **Style**: Establish stylistic guidelines, such as conciseness, formality, or humor, to ensure consistent communication.
- **Response Guidelines**: Specify formatting preferences, question limits, or other structural elements for responses.
- **Task & Goals**: Outline the agent’s objectives and the steps it should take to achieve them.

Example:
```md
## Identity
You are a friendly AI assistant for SubVerse AI. ....

## Style Guardrails
Be concise: ...
Be conversational: ...
...

## Response Guideline
Return dates in their spoken forms: ...
Ask up to one question at a time: ...
...

## Task
1. Greet the user
...
```

## LLM Tools
Take realtime actions by calling functions defined in [LLM Tools section](#llm-tools). Below are the default functions:
- `transfer_call`: Transfer the call to humna agent to handle escalations.
- `end_call`: Hang up the call on closure.
- `query_knowledge_base`: Fetch more details from company knowledge base.

<Tip>
  Explicity instruct the agent to call tool to ensure it is always executed when required, refer to the example below.
</Tip>

Example:
```md
## Task
1. Greet the user
...
4. Troubleshoot the issue by as mentioned in company guide by calling 'query_knowledge_base' tool.
5. If you are unable to solve the problem, politely ask them to hold while you transfer the call to the supervisor and call 'transfer_call' tool.
6. If user do not have any questions, call tool 'end_call' to hang up.
```

## Dynamic Variables
Use variables inside `${}` to personalize responses. Example:
```md
Hello ${customer_name}, how can I help you?
```

## Add pauses
Insert pauses in intial prompt:
```md
<break time="1.0s" /> Hello, this is Puja from SubVerse AI. How may I assist you today?
```
<Tip>
  Add a pause of 1-2 seconds before agent's first speech to account for any delays from customer's side while answering the phone call.
