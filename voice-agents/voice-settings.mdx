## TTS Language
Select the voice output language.

<Tip>
Please make sure to edit this if you want your agent to be able to switch to non-English languages as per customer's response. English-only voices may produce sub-optimal quality in case if non-English responses.
</Tip>

## Voice
Choose the voice ID from the dropdown menu. While we have provided a select few recommended voices - you can always input any voice ID of your choice from [Elevenlabs voice list](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-library/voices-for-conversational-ai)

## Quality
Customize playback quality, we recommend setting this to pcm_16000 for faster results without compromising on quality.

## Speed
Control how fast/slow should the voie agent speak. `2` recommended, `0` slowest, `3` fastest.
