## Transcript Language
Choose the language for speech recognition. Auto detection is enabled only for English, you will have to select a non-English language to make sure agent understands customer speech.

## Allow Interruptions initially
Enable/disable interruptions at the beginning of the call when agent greets the customer.

<Tip>
We recommend setting initial interruption to `False` to ensure agent does not get interrupted when customer greets back with phrases like Hi, Hello, etc.
</Tip>

## Allow Interruptions overall
Enable/disable interruptions during the call.
