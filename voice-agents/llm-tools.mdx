LLM Tools allow your voice agent to perform real-time actions during a call. You can configure multiple tools based on your business needs. While `end_call`, `transfer_call` and `query_knowledge_base` are default tools, you can also configure custom tools by visiting [LLM Tools section](/integrations/llm-tools) in Integrations tab.

<Tip>
Make sure to select all the tools you have mentioned in `system prompt`.
