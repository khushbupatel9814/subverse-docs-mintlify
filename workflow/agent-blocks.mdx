## AI Query Agent
Enables automated decision-making to perform multiple actions (e.g. scheduling callbacks, sending emails, generating tickets) based on dynamic conditions, mimicking human-like intelligence.

**Inputs**
- **Query**: User input or query requiring AI processing. Example:
```md
1. Generate a ticket with comments as per discussion and assign to relevant department.
2. Send an email to the customer with ticket details, CC to customercare@company.com
3. If the customer asked to call later / callback, schedule a callback accordingly
4. If the customer was willing to speak but the call got hung up abruptly, schedule a callback in 5 minutes
```
- **Tools**: Select the tools you want to use to perform specific actions, such as ending an email or generating a ticket.
- **System_Context**: Provide additional context about the user or situation, such as a call transcript or customer details, to help the AI make more informed decisions and keep the conversation truly personalized.
Example text prompt. Remember, you can also link with multiple outputs from other blocks.
```md
You are a backend agent for SubVerse AI to perform multiple tasks based on customer's discussion with virtual agent.
```
- **Knowledge_Base**: Option to Select Knowledge Base to pull relevant information from your company documents.

**Outputs**
- **LLM_Response**: The AI Query Agent generates a response based on the user's query, using the context and knowledge base you provided.
- **Tool Outputs**: The block also produces outputs from the selected tools, which can be used as inputs to [function blocks](/workflow/function-blocks), allowing you to automate follow-up tasks or notifications.
